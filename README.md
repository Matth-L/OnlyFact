# OnlyFact

## Overview 
OnlyFact is a school project developed using Angular and Spring Boot. The purpose of this project is to gain practical insights into agile practices and project management in a real-world context.
Our goal was to create a blog where people can share facts. Users have the ability to identify, connect, and send messages without the typical social media features such as likes. We aimed for a simpler approach, focusing on the main goal of enjoying facts posted by users.
